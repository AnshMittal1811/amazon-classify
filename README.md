# Viewing the Amazon From Space 

This repository contains a solution to the Kaggle Competition 'Viewing the Amazon From Space.' The code is based heavily on Jason Brownlee's post on how to build a CNN using the Planet data at this link. This README will cover the following steps of our own data pipeline. 
  
  * Introduction
  * How to Prepare Data for Modeling
  * Model Evaluation Measure
  * How to Evaluate a Baseline Model
  * How to Improve Model Performance
  * How to use Transfer Learning
  * How to Finalize the Model and Make Predictions
  
We will aim to use this as a template for future Sociometrik tasks using machine learning on satellite imagery.

# Introduction 

The Planet data consists of 40000 256 X 256 .jpg images along with 17 labels that were created and and labelled by the organization Planet. The testing data consists of another 80000 images that were used to grade the final solutions. These testing data are also 256 X 256 .jpg images. 

The target labels consist of different land types and descriptions which may occur together (hazy, desert, forest, rainy ,etc). There are 17 possible labels. This is a **multi-label classification problem.** This means that any subset of 17 labels can exist in a single picture. Our task is to predict which of these 17 labels exists in any given image of the Amazon rainforest.

# How to Prepare Data for Modeling

There are two steps in our process for preparing the data for modelling. First we have to process the images and then we have to process the labels so that both are structured in an easy way for us to train the model.

#### Clone the repository

First clone the repository onto your local machine. The command to do this is given below: 

```shell
	git clone https://github.com/sociometrik/planet-rep.git 
```

This will create a folder called **planet-rep** on your machine with the Jupyter notebook scripts and others.

#### Folder structure

The folder structure for the scripts is the same as in the GitHub repository except for the  training data folders. This is not stored on GitHub as it is too large and we do not want to put it into version control anyway. The structure diagram is given below: 
     
     --- planet-rep
	       -- train-jpg
		       -- train_0.jpg
		       -- train_1.jpg
		       -- train_2.jpg
			       ...
		       -- train_40478.jpg
	       -- train_v2.csv
	       -- planet_data.npz
	       -- planet_rep_train.ipynb
	       -- planet_rep.ipynb
	       -- README.md
	       -- requirements.txt
	       -- setup.sh
	       -- test_evaluation_plot.png
	       -- train-jpg.tar
	       -- train-jpg.tar.7z

#### Getting the training data

- Go to the Kaggle competition page for **Planet: Viewing the Amazon from Space** at this link. 
- Then click on the **data** tab. 
- Then scroll down until you find a folder called **train-jpg**. 
- Hover your mouse over this until a **download icon** appears.
- Click on the download icon 
- The download of train-jpg.tar should start - Once this is done you can use any program like Winzip or Mac Unarchiver to unzip the tar file
- You will then have the folder **train-jpg** with the jpg images    
- Move **train-jpg.tar** and **train-jpg** into the repository folder according to the structure above
- Then go back to the Kaggle competition page 
- Download **train_v2.csv** and place it in the folder according to the structure above


#### Labels 

Labels are given separately from the images in the train_2.csv file with two columns: 1) file name and 2) label in the format 'haze rain desert forest.' This means each data point is labelled by writing in plain text the words corresponding to whatever exists in the picture in one string separated by single spaces. To see what it looks like, we load the .csv file using the following function: 
```python
   def load_mapping_data('./train_v2.csv'):
	   ...
	   return(...)
```
Visualizing the first few rows of the returned data-frame gives us the following output: 
```
  
image_name 	tags 
0 train_0 	haze primary 
1 train_1 	agriculture clear primary water 
2 train_2 	clear primary 
3 train_3 	clear primary 
4 train_4 	agriculture clear habitation primary road
```

Next, we check to see which unique values the labels can take. To do this, and for use later on in the code, we use the data-frame we have made above to create two mapping dictionaries. The first dictionary has class labels as keys and integers as values and the second goes the other way around. The function which does in the code is given below: 

```python
   def get_tag_mapping(mapping_df):
	   ...
	   return(...)
```

Calling this function will result in the following two dictionaries: 

```
{'agriculture': 0, 'artisinal_mine': 1, 'bare_ground': 2, 'blooming': 3, 'blow_down': 4, 'clear': 5, 'cloudy': 6, 'conventional_mine': 7, 'cultivation': 8, 'habitation': 9, 'haze': 10, 'partly_cloudy': 11, 'primary': 12, 'road': 13, 'selective_logging': 14, 'slash_burn': 15, 'water': 16}
```
 ```
 {0: 'agriculture', 1: 'artisinal_mine', 2: 'bare_ground', 3: 'blooming', 4: 'blow_down', 5: 'clear', 6: 'cloudy', 7: 'conventional_mine', 8: 'cultivation', 9: 'habitation', 10: 'haze', 11: 'partly_cloudy', 12: 'primary', 13: 'road', 14: 'selective_logging', 15: 'slash_burn', 16: 'water'}
 ```  

Next, we need to relate these functions to the images. For that, we use a function called: 
```python
	def create_file_mapping(mapping_df):
	...
	return(...)
```
This function returns a third dictionary with keys as image file names and values as a list of all the labels that are given for that picture. An example of the output for the first training image is given below: 
```
{'train_0': ['haze', 'primary'], 'train_1': ['agriculture', 'clear', 'primary', 'water']}
```

These dictionaries are useful for us not only to know the unique labels in the data-set but also because all supervised machine learning algorithms take only numbers as input and not strings. We need to one-hot encode the information we have. These dictionaries will allow us to do so. The function which does the one-hot encoding for us is given in the code by: 

```python
   def one_hot_encode(tags, labels_map):
	   ...
	   return(...)
```
A sample function call with sample output is given below. 
```python
print(one_hot_encode(['agriculture', 'clear', 'primary', 'water'], labels_map))

[1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
```
How does the function know where to put 1s and 0s? Agriculture is one of the labels. The integer for agriculture according to our previous mapping dictionary is 0. So the 0th element of the list above is given a 1 value by the one-hot encoding. The value of clear is 5 according to our label to integer dictionary. So the value at index 5 of the list above is given a 1. Now we are ready to compress the data-set and store it for training.

#### Images 

First we compress the images to 32 X 32 or any other desired target size and then convert these to a numerical array. We need to compress the images if we are running this without a GPU regardless of whether they are on our local machine or on a cloud server. This is to keep the training time manageable as this is just a test case for us to learn the data processing pipeline for satellite imagery. The functions which do this in the code are: 

```python 
		def compress_dataset(path, file_mapping, tag_mapping, 
							 target_size = (128, 128)):
			...	
			return(X, y)

def prep_data(folder = 'train-jpg/', target_size = (32, 32)):
	...
	np.savez_compressed('planet_data.npz', X, y)
	return(...)
```

These two function will output a file to the repository folder	 with format **.npz** which is a Python built-in compressed file format for numerical arrays. The file will be called **planet_data.npz**. Now that this is done we are finally ready to move ahead with training.
